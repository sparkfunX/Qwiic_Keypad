  This example demonstrates how to change the I2C address via software.

  Note: To change the address you can also open the on-board jumper. This will force the address to 74 (0x4A).

  Note: If you change the address to something unknown you can either open the jumper (goes to address 0x4A) or
  use the I2C scanner sketch (Example 4).

byte keypadAddress = 75; //75 is default, 74 if jumper is opened
byte newAddress = 55; //Must be 0x08 <= newAddress <= 0x77

  Wire.begin();
  
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Qwiic KeyPad Change Address Example");
  Serial.println("Press a key to begin");

  while(Serial.available()) Serial.read(); //Clear buffer
  while(!Serial.available()) delay(1); //Wait for user to press button  

  //The new address must be 0x08 <= address <= 0x77
  if(changeKeyPadAddress(keypadAddress, newAddress) == true) //Old address, new address
  {
    keypadAddress = newAddress;
    Serial.println("Address successfully changed to 0x" + String(keypadAddress, HEX));
